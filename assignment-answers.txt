For the following situations, determine which search approach to use and why would you take that approach. Write your answers in the submission box below.

1. Performing a search of a sorted by name IRS database for a taxpayer name
2. Searching through an unsorted list containing the days of the weekend
3. Given a list of the planets in the Milky Way in ascending order by size, search for a planet with a given size.
4. Searching for a checkpoint name in an unsorted list of Bloc checkpoints

ANSWERS
1. Binary search with divide and conquer algorithm on a sorted list would filter out 1/2 of the list in each iteration.
2. Iterative search would be suitable for an unsorted list because the target can be at anywhere in the list so the binary search doesn't necessarily help.
3. Binary search would be a better method because the sizes are in a sorted order. Same as #1. Generally the divide and conquer algorithm is a better way.
4. Iterative would be sufficient for an unsorted list of Bloc checkpoints with the same reasoning as #2. Since the target can be at anywhere, the binary search won't help.
